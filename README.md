- First project: Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
- Second project: Image Classifier

## 📌Project 1: Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

**Project Overview:**  

**🎯 Objectives:**  
- Correctly identify which pet images are dogs vs. not dogs.  
- Accurately classify the breed of dog in the images.  
- Compare performance of CNN architectures: ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG.

🛠️**Tools Used:**
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Pre-trained CNN models (ResNet, AlexNet, VGG)  

## 📌 Project 2: Image Classifier with Deep Learning

**Project Overview:**  
In this project, I developed an image classifier using deep learning with PyTorch. The task involved building and training a neural network on a flower dataset, then creating a command-line application to predict image classes using the trained model.

**🎯Objectives:**  
- Build and train a deep learning image classifier.  
- Save and load model checkpoints efficiently.  
- Develop a command-line interface for training and prediction.  
- Achieve reliable classification on the flower dataset.

🛠️**Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Torchvision
