# AI-Programming-with-Python

This page contains my participation in  "AI Programming with Python" provided by Udacity  https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089.


- First project: Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

 The goal of this project is to improve my programming skills using Python. In this project, you will use a pre-created image classifier to identify dog breeds.

 The principal objectives of this project are to correctly identify which pet images are of dogs versus which ones are not, as well as to accurately classify the breed of dog for the images. Additionally, I will determine which convolutional neural network (CNN) model architecture - ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG - best achieves.
