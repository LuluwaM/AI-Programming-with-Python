- First project: Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
- Second project: Image Classifier

## 📌Project 1: Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

**Project Overview:**  

**🎯 Objectives:**  
- Correctly identify which pet images are dogs vs. not dogs.  
- Accurately classify the breed of dog in the images.  
- Compare performance of CNN architectures: ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG.

## 🛠️**Tools Used:**
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Pre-trained CNN models (ResNet, AlexNet, VGG)
